Hi {{ first_name }},

Thanks for reaching out — getting your digital estate organised is one of the most thoughtful things you can do for your family.

Your Digital Estate Readiness Checklist is attached to this email as a PDF.

It covers 9 essential areas:

  1. About You
  2. Key People & Helpers
  3. Core Estate Documents
  4. Important Supporting Documents
  5. Money, Bills & Subscriptions
  6. Email, Social Media & Online Accounts
  7. Devices & Access
  8. Delegations & What Your Family Needs to Know
  9. Keeping Things Up to Date

Print it out, work through each section, and store it somewhere trusted — alongside any existing estate documents.

When you're ready to turn this checklist into a full secure digital plan, we're here to help:
